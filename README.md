# My Python Projects (0 to Hero)

Welcome to my **"0 to Hero"** Python portfolio! This repository contains a series of projects that showcase my learning journey in Python -- from the basic to more advanced topics. Each project resides in it own folder, along with relevant documentation and code.

### Overview

This repository is a collection of **100+ Python projects** (and potentially more!), each focusing on different concepts, techniques, and libraries in Python. The aim is to:

- **Learn by Doing:** Demonstrate incremental growth in programming skills.
- **Explore Various Domains:** From simple console-based scripts to web applications, data analysis, automation, and more.
- **Build a Portfolio:** Showcase each project so that other (including potential collaborators or employers) can see progression and depth.

### Repository Structure

Each project is contained in a separate folder with its own name and number, for example:

```
My_Python_Projects/
My_Python_Projects/
├── 01_Age_Calculator/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 02_Another_Project/
│   ├── ...
│   └── ...
├── 03_Text_Based_Game/
├── 04_...
├── .gitignore
├── README.md  <-- (this file)
└── ...
```

within each project's folder:

- `main.py` (or similarly named script) contains the main code.
- `README.md` gives details specific to that project (usage, requirements, etc.).
- Additional files or folders (e.g., `requirements.txt`, data files, or submodules) may exist as needed.
